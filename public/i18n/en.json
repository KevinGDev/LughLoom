  "aboutText" : "LughLoom is a next-generation tabletop roleplaying platform where the game master is an artificial intelligence — capable of weaving deep, dynamic adventures entirely shaped by your choices. No pre-written plots, no rigid structure: every story is spun in real time, responding to your actions, ideas, and imagination.\n\nThe name LughLoom carries the spirit of this vision:\n\nLugh is a major deity from Celtic mythology, known as the god of light, art, oaths, and storytelling. A master of many crafts, Lugh represents wisdom, creativity, and versatility.\n\nA loom is an ancient tool used to weave fabric — but metaphorically, it symbolizes the weaving of fate, the crafting of stories, one thread at a time.\n\nSo, LughLoom means “Lugh’s loom” — a sacred, digital space where tales are woven with you at their center, guided by a storyteller born from myth and machine.\n\nWhether you play solo or with friends, in a medieval world, post-apocalyptic wasteland, or surreal dreamscape, the AI acts as a living game master: it brings characters to life, describes your surroundings, reacts to your choices, and builds the story around you.\n\nThere are no rules to memorize, no prep time — just your curiosity.\nLughLoom weaves. You explore.\nTogether, you write a legend."
